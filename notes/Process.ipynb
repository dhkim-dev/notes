    "### `Process`\n",
    "\n",
    "In computing, a process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Parent Process`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the operating system Unix, every process(except the very first one) is created when a process creates a new process. Those 2 processes establish a relationship where: aparent process is the process that created the new process\n",
    "and a child process is the newly-created process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every process (except the very first one) has one parent process, and\n",
    "can have many child processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Child Process`\n",
    "\n",
    "A child process is a process created by another process(the parent process). Each process may create many child processes but will have at most one parent process; if a process does not have a parent this usually indicates that it was created directly by the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "A child process inherits most of its attributes, such as open files, from its parent process. In UNIX, a child process is in fact created (using `fork`) as a copy of the parent. The purpose of fork is to create a new process, which becomes the child process of the caller. \n",
    "\n",
    "The child process can then overlay itself with a different program as required. The child process and the parent process run in separate memory spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Orphan Process`\n",
    "\n",
    "An orphan process is a running process whose parent process has finished or terminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Unix-like operating system, any orphaned process will be immediately adopted by the special `init` system process. This operation is called re-parenting and occurs automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though technically the orphan process has the `init` process as its parent, it is still called an orphan process since the process that originally created it no longer exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A process can be orphaned unintentionally such as when the parent process terminates or crashes. The process group mechanism in most Unix-like operation systems can be used to protect against accidental orphaningby trying to terminate all the child processes with the SIGHUP process signal, rather than letting them continue to run as orphans.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A process may also be intentionally orphaned. It becomes detached and left running in the background; usually to allow a long-running job to complete without further user attention, or to start an indefinitely running service.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Init Process`\n",
    "\n",
    "`init` (short for initialization) is the first process started during booting of the computer system. Init is a daemon process that continues running until the system is shut down. It is the direct or indirect ancestor of all other processes and automatically adopts all orphaned processes. Init is typically assigned process identifier 1. In Mac OS, `init` is called `launchd`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Dameon Process`\n",
    "\n",
    "A daemon process is an intintionally orphaned process in order to have a background process. A daemon process is usually created by a process forking a child process and then immediately exiting, thus causing init to adopt the child process. In a Unix environment, the parent process of a daemon is often, but not always, the init process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically daemon names end with the letter d: for example, syslogd is the daemon that implements the system logging facility and sshd is a daemon that services incoming SSH connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Zombie Process`\n",
    "\n",
    "A defunct process, also known as a zombie, is simply a process that is no longer running, but remains in the process table to allow the parent to collect its exit status information before removing it from the process table. Because a zombie is no longer running, it does not use any system resources such as CPU or disk, and it only uses a small amount of memory for storing the exit status.\n",
    "\n",
    "A zombie process is not the same as an orphan process. An orphan process is a process that is still executing, but whose parent has died. They do not become zombie processes; instead, they are adopted by init (process ID 1), which waits on its children.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Process Identifier aka PID`\n",
    "\n",
    "The operating system kernel identifies each process by its numerical process identifier - PID. PPID stands for Parent PID.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Process Table`\n",
    "\n",
    "The process table is a registry of all running processes (or exited before being reaped) in the system. Each process is represented by an process entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the operating system (OS), a process may be made up of multiple threads of execution that execute instructions concurrently.\n"
