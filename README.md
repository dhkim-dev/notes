# notes

A hodge podge of notes that I have authored in the first 3 months of onboarding at Shopify. The degree to which the notes can help my colleagues will be varied. Some colleagues are tenured and have worked w/ Ruby, RoR, and Sorbet for a very long time; they will find these notes common knowledge and redundant. For others who are new to the ecosystem, this will be timely knowledge that they wish had existed in a Vault document somewhere.

Publishing these notes is my way of contributing towards knowledge scaling. I want to make sure that any insights I uncover can get transferred beyond a single targeted recipient.
